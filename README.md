A Linked List class has been provided to you; you are going to use it as a member to create a stack class or a queue class, your choice. 
Both stacks and queues retrieve items from the front, or head. Queues add items to the end of the list, while stacks add items to the 
front of the list.

Once you define your class, I want you to create a short main function similar to test.cpp that inserts 3-4 items, displays the contents, 
removes 1-2 items, and displays the contents again.

You will be responsible for functions for insertion and deletion of items according to stack or queue rules, and displaying the contents.
