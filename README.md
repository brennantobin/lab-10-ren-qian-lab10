A Linked List class has been provided to you; you are going to use it as a member to create a stack class or a queue class, your choice. 
Both stacks and queues retrieve items from the front, or head. Queues add items to the end of the list, while stacks add items to the 
front of the list.

Once you define your class and methods, I want you to create a short main function similar to test.cpp that inserts 3-4 items, displays 
the contents, removes 1-2 items, and displays the contents again. This should all be submitted in One (1) SINGLE .cpp file for the 
purposes of this assignment (if we were working on a larger or more lasting project, it would be divided into .h and .cpp files).

You will be responsible for functions for insertion and deletion of items according to stack or queue rules, and displaying the contents.
Consider use of the Linked List class's methods as basic building blocks of your approach.
